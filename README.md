## 🚀 Welcome to Winix 

Winix is a cross-platform command-line application designed to bridge the gap between Unix/Linux and Windows environments. Built with Rust for optimal performance and reliability, it provides native implementations of essential Unix commands that Windows users frequently need.

---

## 📦 Key Features

- **Native Windows Integration:** Direct Windows API integration, no WSL required.
- **High Performance:** Rust-based, optimized for speed and low resource usage.
- **Async/Await Support:** Modern async programming with Tokio runtime for efficient I/O operations.
- **Stream Processing:** Real-time data processing with Rust's Stream trait for memory-efficient operations.
- **User Experience:** Colorized output, consistent CLI, Windows-compatible paths.
- **Comprehensive Command Suite:** Includes `chmod`, `chown`, `uname`, `ps`, `cat`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, and more.
- **Command Pipelines:** Chain multiple commands together for complex data processing workflows.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new commands and features.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Build from Source

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/0xsambit/winix.git
cd winix
cargo build --release
```

### Using Async Commands

Winix now supports async/await for high-performance file operations:

```rust
// Async file concatenation
let result = cat_async_to_string(vec!["file1.txt", "file2.txt"]).await?;

// Async pattern matching
let matches = grep_async_to_string("pattern", vec!["file.txt"]).await?;

// Async head/tail operations
let first_lines = head_async_to_string(vec!["file.txt"], 10).await?;
let last_lines = tail_async_to_string(vec!["file.txt"], 10).await?;

// Command pipelines
let pipeline = CatGrepPipeline::new(
    vec!["file.txt".to_string()],
    "pattern".to_string(),
);
let result = execute_pipeline(pipeline).await?;
```

## 🤝 How to Contribute - 
### Check - [Discussions](https://github.com/0xsambit/winix/discussions) before going forward

We welcome all contributions! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or helping others, your input is valued.

### Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Click the "Fork" button on GitHub to create your own copy.
2. **Clone Your Fork**
   - `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/winix.git`
3. **Create a Branch**
   - `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. **Make Changes**
   - Implement your feature or fix in the appropriate module.
   - Follow the code style and formatting standards (see below).
   - Run `cargo run`
5. **Test Your Changes**
   - Run `cargo test` to ensure all tests pass.
6. **Commit and Push**
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "Add <feature/fix>"`
   - `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub and click "New Pull Request".
   - Fill in a clear description of your changes.
8. **Respond to Reviews**
   - Address feedback and make necessary updates.
  
 Most importantly, create a upstream to the main branch of the repo, and pull all the changes as soon as the main branch updates. If any PR causes any wrong change in any other part, than what was pushed, it will be immediately revoked and no further points will be given.

### Code Style & Standards

- Use Rust 2021 Edition.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Add tests for new features.
- Keep external dependencies minimal.
- For async features, use Tokio runtime and follow async/await best practices.

### Issue Reporting
- Firstly, use the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/0xsambit/winix/discussions) to discuss which issues to work on and talk about the features or any questions about the project. Everything related to the project has to be first address in the discussions under appropriate category, only after then issues will be assigned. 
- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/0xsambit/winix/issues) for bugs, feature requests, and questions.
- Provide detailed steps to reproduce bugs.
- It is important to note that if the PA doesn't assign an issue to you, and you complete the PR, it will still be accepted ( if it is correct ) , but no points will be given
